# WorkLoadManagementSystem-main
Nowadays, in our busy and fast-moving world, we can’t do most of the things manually. All
our need become online-based or web-based. In this way, in education field it is difficult to
maintain the workload and work norm for the academic staffs of a faculty which also affect
their research and the progress of their skills within particular time period. But if have a web
application for calculating the workload for a year, for a week or for whole semester, it is
easy for them to do their research and teaching. It is recognized that faculty staffs should
have ‘Academic freedom’ to teach and carry out research without any interference; be open
and flexible in their academic activities; and undertake outside their employment that
enhance their intellect and professional skills, without forfeiting their primary commitments
to the university. Therefore, guidelines on workload and work norms for academics helps
exercising the academic freedom without affecting adversely on their ‘Academic
Accountability’. These guidelines consider the complexities and diversities of activities
performed by the academics, which include not only teaching and research work, but also
contributions to university and national development. This project is implementing a web
application which state different aspects to be considered in developing a calculating
workload model common to all the academics in the Faculty of Applied Science, University
of Vavuniya. As such, the mechanism incorporates aspects in Teaching, Research and
contribution to the Faculty, University and National Development into this model for the
development process.
